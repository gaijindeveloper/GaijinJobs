# Optimizations: If you don't want to optimize, use the
# proguard-android.txt configuration file instead of this one, which
# turns off the optimization flags.  Adding optimization introduces
# certain risks, since for example not all optimizations performed by
# ProGuard works on all versions of Dalvik.  The following flags turn
# off various optimizations known to have issues, but the list may not
# be complete or up to date. (The "arithmetic" optimization can be
# used if you are only targeting Android 2.0 or later.)  Make sure you
# test thoroughly if you go this route.

# We target Android >= 2.2 (as of v6.1.0), don't disable arithmetic optimizations :
-optimizations !code/simplification/cast,!field/*,!class/merging/*
# Original (default) optimization passes were 5 but one of the libraries we link don't pass it so
# we reduce it to 2 :
-optimizationpasses 2
-allowaccessmodification

# The remainder of this file is identical to the non-optimized version
# of the Proguard configuration file (except that the other file has
# flags to turn off optimization).
